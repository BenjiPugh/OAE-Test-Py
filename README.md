# OAE-Test-Py
A python based Otoacoustic Emissions hearing test. In progress!


Current state has live playback and recording with frequency analysis at the end.


Future plans:
- Calculate OAE dB vs background and aggregate properly to get a final result
- Save playback and recording as separate .wav files
- Transform into a more built out library
- Incorporate chirps for fitment testing and loudness calibration
