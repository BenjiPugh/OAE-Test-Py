# OAE-Test-Py
A python based Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE) hearing test. In progress!


Current state has live playback and recording with frequency analysis at the end, calculating the average magnitude of the stimulus and OAE tones

To run in terminal, enter:
`python oae_test.py`

Future plans:
- Calculate OAE dB vs background and aggregate properly to get a final result
- Save playback and recording as separate .wav files
- Transform into a more built out library
- Incorporate chirps for fitment testing and loudness calibration
